# ReachSphere
ReachSphere is a resource pack which displays the player's attack range in Survival mode, using core shaders in vanilla minecraft.
This allows you to measure the distance between you and your opponent and identify if your attack will hit them.
However, This resource pack makes me weak.
# Notes
ReachSphere is a resource pack which uses core shaders, not a shader pack.
I am not responsible if you are banned from the server for using this resource pack.
# Known issues
Partially incompatible with Sodium.
This resource pack might be incompatible with resource packs or mods that disable fog.
